<h3>Genetic Algorithms</h3>
<p>Genetic algorithms were created a method to study the natural phenomenon of adaption in nature. Through constant iteration, they create entities that become optimised at performing a task. As they are inspired by natural selection, they often use techniques of selection, mutation and inheritance. The system always starts with a set or random population of entities which are given scores when the compete against each other in a manner set by the creator. The entity or entities with the highest scores are then used to make a new population produced from their offspring. This offspring will have some characterises from their parents, and some characteristics produced through random mutation. This process will then run either indefinitely or until a suitable solution has been reached.</p>

<h3>About the simulator</h3>
<p>The simulator creates a set of non-playable stick figures that will navigate their way around obstacles placed within an environment. Obstacles will include spikes, pits, and steps. These stick figures will each have randomly generated attributes such as walk speed, jump height, and distance. Other attributes such as health will remain constant. At first they will move randomly, but over generations will improve at overcoming obstacles.</p>
